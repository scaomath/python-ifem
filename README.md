# πfem
πfem (Python-iFEM) is a small Python finite element lib based on the popular MATLAB package [iFEM](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem). The main core of this package is ported from iFEM, and is largely readable extremely suitable for pedagogical purposes. The procedure is sequential in nature, instead of embracing the modern obj-oriented modular style.
